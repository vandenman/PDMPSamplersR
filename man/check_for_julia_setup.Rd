\usage{
check_for_julia_setup(error_if_not_exists = FALSE, setup_if_not_exists = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{error_if_not_exists}{logical, if TRUE, will throw an error if the Julia project is not found. If FALSE, will attempt to set up the project if setup_if_not_exists is TRUE.}

\item{setup_if_not_exists}{logical, if FALSE and `error_if_not_exists` is FALSE, will not throw an error but printif the Julia project is not found. If TRUE, will attempt to set up the project if `error_if_not_exists` is FALSE.}
}
\value{
TRUE if the Julia project is successfully loaded or set up, \code{FALSE} otherwise (if `error_if_not_exists` is also \code{FALSE}). If `error_if_not_exists` is \code{TRUE}, will throw an error if the project cannot be loaded or set up.
}
\description{
Check if the Julia Project is Setup Properly
}
\details{
This function checks for the existence of the Julia project for PDMPSamplers.jl, and if it exists, loads it and the required packages. If it does not exist, it can either throw an error or attempt to set up the project, depending on the parameters. It is mostly useful for internal use to ensure the Julia environment is ready before calling any functions that depend on it, but can also be called directly by users if they want to check or set up the Julia project.
